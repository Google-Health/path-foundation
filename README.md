# Path Foundation

Path Foundation is a machine learning (ML) model that produces embeddings based
on digital pathology images. The embeddings can be used to efficiently build AI
models for pathology analysis-related tasks, requiring less data and less
compute than having to fully train a model without the embeddings.

As a Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF) model trained on large scale
datasets, Path Foundation helps businesses and institutions in healthcare and
life sciences do more with less pathology data, accelerating their ability to
build AI models for pathology image analysis.

## Get started

*   Read our
    [developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/health-ai-developer-foundations/path-foundation/get-started)
    to see the full range of next steps available, including learning more about
    the model through its
    [model card](https://developers.google.com/health-ai-developer-foundations/path-foundation/model-card)
    or
    [serving API](https://developers.google.com/health-ai-developer-foundations/path-foundation/serving-api).

*   Explore this repository, which contains [notebooks](./notebooks) for using
    the model from Hugging Face and Vertex AI as well as the
    [implementation](./python/serving) of the container that you can deploy to Vertex
    AI.

*   Visit the model on
    [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/path-foundation) or
    [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/path-foundation).
